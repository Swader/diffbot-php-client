# Diffbot PHP API Wrapper

This package is a slightly overengineered Diffbot API wrapper. It uses Guzzle to make API calls. To learn more about Diffbot see [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/tag/diffbot/) and [their homepage](http://diffbot.com).
Right now it only supports Analyze, Product, Image and Article APIs, but can also accommodate Custom APIs. Crawlbot, Search and Discussion API support coming soon.

## Requirements

Minimum PHP 5.4 because Guzzle needs it.

## Install

Via Composer

```bash
composer require swader/diffbot-php-client
```

## Usage

Todo

## Testing

```bash
phpunit
```
