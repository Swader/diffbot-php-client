## Low

- see what can be done with the [URL report](https://www.diffbot.com/dev/docs/crawl/) - some implementation options?
- add more usage examples
- work on PhpDoc consistency ($param type vs type $param)
- get more mock responses and test against them
- write example with custom EntityIterator (different Entity set for different API) and custom Entity (i.e. authorProfile, which parses some of the data and prepares for further use)
